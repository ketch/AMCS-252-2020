Take $I(0) = 0.001$, $R(0)=0$, and $S(0)=0.999$.  For now ignore social measures (take $q(t)=1$).  Run your model with the following parameter values and comment on the results:\n",

You may use whatever methodology you wish, but you need to provide your sources and be able to explain your approach.  Run the model with initial data corresponding to the current real world numbers and with $q(t)=1$.  What fraction of the world population is eventually infected?  What is the maximum value of $I(t)$?\n",
